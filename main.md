### 🧩 Problem Statement: Adaptive Load Management in Gamified Systems

**Objective:**  
Design a dynamic system that intelligently adapts to fluctuating energy and interaction loads within real-time gamified environments. The solution should aim to maximize performance output while minimizing energy latency — especially under rapidly changing conditions (stacking, rotating, clearing).

**Context:**  
As interactive systems evolve, maintaining balance between performance and sustainability becomes increasingly complex — especially when dealing with modular, fast-paced input streams. Think in blocks. Think in bursts. Think fast.

**Resources:**  
- Reaction-time datasets (available on request)  
- [Scan the architecture schema for additional insights](./assets/image_qr.png )

🕹️ *Note: Unexpected load patterns may emerge. Stay sharp — more data will fall into place during the live brief session.*
